        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience? The first thing that stuck out to me was how the
        background colour shifted as the window resized even though it appeared
        to be a static image, so I was intrigued with how it was coded.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions. Clicking to turn on and off the music, and
        resizing the browser window to be taller and thinner as well as wider.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with? Changing the browser window to various shapes to see how the
        webpage changed, I also tried to see if it effected the backing music
        but I believe that it doesn’t.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience? Resizing the browser window, to various widths.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience? To be an interactive experience, showcasing
        colour changing use html, as well as shadow and light refractions.
        Potentially also using some form of Javascript to assist with this,
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? It
        has a simple text prompt that appears at the start as well as an arrow
        to the right-hand side of the browser window to show how to resize it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times) I personally
        feel that it can really only be interacted from start to finish once as
        there is a clear start and end point, however during it I feel people
        can move it around as much as they so please or possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time? The arrow on the right-hand side moves as the
        window is scaled, as well as the sun rises giving a clear feedback loop
        for the user interaction.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference? I feel like its aesthetic match other works found in the
        synthwave art style, with the colour palette, sunset and palm tress
        being a common factor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience? It doesn’t specifically
        communicate that as I believe it is more of an aesthetic reference.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience? The relaxed music and
        summer aesthetics lead to the feel of calm and warmth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating? Sometimes the resizing is a bit laggy as
        well as I’m not sure how well it works on a laptop screen, it might be
        better on a larger screen. This is because there is only so much screen
        real estate that can be used, and I am confident it wouldn’t work on any
        other device that doesn’t support window resizing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="outer">
      <p class="box">
        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying? The slow and smooth shift of colour gradient
        of the sunset, this with the moving shadows and suns reflection on the
        water make a very immersive experience.

        Unfortunately, while I got the iframe working to showcase the webpage, I
        discovered that if the webpage is resized to a very small width it
        unlocks another experience to interact with. This discovery was made
        from the iframe because it can be scaled smaller than Chrome allows a
        window to be on a laptop. Because I only found this out on the due date
        my answers above are only for the first half of the page while it's
        being resized.
